How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- Interpreting user needs revolves around the initial requirements of the project, which are then tied into user interviews and user stories. The requirements lay the baseline foundation for what needs to be accomplished in the project. Once this baseline is present, user interviews can occur to see what features the users would like to see implemented into the application. Once these have been taken into consideration, the user stories can be created to document these changing requirements that can be implemented and tested to ensure their functionality.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- My approach to developing programs is an iterative process, which ties in with the agile methodology. Agile will become a large part of my development process, as I want to ensure that I am constantly iterating, testing, and updating requirements to create the best application possible. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- To be a good team member, is to handle all of your tasks within the designated timeline, to ask for help when you need clarification on something, so that the project isn't delayed, and to help team members whenever they need it as well. Communcation throughout the entire development process is key to ensure that the team stays on the same page about everything and everyone is able to accomplish their tasks within the designated timeframe.
